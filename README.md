# critical-velocity
One of several projects based on my proprietary game engine, QEngine2. A 3D racing game.

Features:
- modular architecture allowing utilization of different graphics and sound subsystem implementations, compiled as separate .dll libraries
- written in C++ and HLSL
- graphics subsystem based on DirectX, started working on Vulkan implementation
- sound subsystem based on FMOD library
- physics utilizing Nvidia PhysX middleware SDK
- performance optimization techniques such as viewing frustum culling and Level of detail
- particle system-based smoke
- my other projects based on this engine are an FPP Bomberman-like game, and a submarine simulator
